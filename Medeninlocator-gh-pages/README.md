# Medeninlocator
This is a web based application which locates hospitals / clinics  / labs on Google Maps. This project is based on Google Maps API and gives the exact location and information of stores present in a particular pin-code.
When user enters the pin-code, this application display address,phone number and location of all the centres located in that area. I choosed Medenin as an enterprise because availability of so many health centre within an area. Currently It locates 11 centres present in pin-code of 110051/110092/110031/110029 but we can surely add more stores in future.
